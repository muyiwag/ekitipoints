      <h2>About</h2>

<p>In January 2011, the newly elected Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, requested an NGO (<strong>Development Support Initiatives or DSI</strong>) to organize a Free Health Mission in fulfillment of his campaign promises to the people of the state.</p>

<p>DSI traveled to all 16 local government areas (LGAs) of Ekiti State with about 150 medical personnel and stayed in each town for a full day. They were ultimately able to treat over 100,000 citizens with a variety of conditions</p>

<p>During the one-day Free Health Mission in each LGA, the DSI Data Team would fan out into the surrounding neighborhoods with GPS recorders and clipboards in order to collect health-related points of interest (POIs) such as water sources (boreholes, wells, streams), primary health centers, pharmacies, public toilets and refuse sites.</p>  

<p>These POIs are important for epidemiological investigations; for example, locations of water sources can be used to trace the roots of many common water-borne diseases such as guineaworm or water blindness.</p>

<p>The map above shows the locations of these POIs in selected towns.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Drag the map with the cursor to move to a town of interest</li>
      <li>Use the zoom controls (buttons labeled '+' and '-') to zoom in on the town of interest</li>
      <li>The POIs are labeled with icons (e.g. a cross represents a hospital, a water drop represents a water source).</li>
      <li>Hold your cursor over the icon for the POI and a box will appear showing details of that POI.</li>
      <li>Add a stamp and mail in your form</li>
    </ol>
